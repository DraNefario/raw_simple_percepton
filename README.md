# raw_simple_percepton

While studying artificial intelligence and neural networks, I became curious not just about how to use them — but how they were built from the ground up.

With help from ChatGPT, I deepened my understanding of neural networks starting from the fundamentals:

What a neural network really is

Its historical origin and core mathematics

The logic of the AND gate using weights and thresholds

And finally, the Perceptron — the first model capable of learning through supervised training.

Fascinated by how the perceptron works, I decided to implement one myself using only basic algebra and logic, without relying on any high-level libraries.

This repository contains that raw, minimal implementation of a simple perceptron, built for educational purposes and to reinforce my understanding of the foundations of machine learning.
